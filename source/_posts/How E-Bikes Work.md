Electric power bikes pedal and handle as being a regular bicycle. By and large, an electric bike use the same parts also. The electrical component is meant to augment human electric power, not entirely replace it. It makes obstacles like hills and headwind extra manageable and permits you to travel even more without getting as worn out.

Comfort and quality of the components remain as important on a power bike because they are on a normal bicycle. But today, there are a few more things you must consider.

# The Motor

Electric bike motors come in a wide variety of power ratings, from 200W to 1 1,000W or even more. The legal limit in America is 750W, although several claims can set their private limits.

Think of this limit sort of like horsepower. An increased rating implies that the bike will be able to pull more excess weight with greater convenience - but at the expense of using more electric battery capacity while doing so. Consequently, a 750W electric motor will drain the electric battery much quicker than a 250W one, but it will be more powerful.

One more factor has to be considered, however. The look and location of the motor takes on a crucial role in how electrical bikes work.

The most common type of motor for electric bikes is named a hub electric motor. It is generally included into the trunk or front wheel. When involved, it pulls or pushes the wheel along. Although this technique works well, it has one key disadvantage. Because it is not connected to the bike’s gears, it loses performance on hills and varied terrain. Imagine generating a vehicle in only one gear the entire day. It'll get you places, nonetheless it won’t provide you with the optimum quantity of torque or speed that you will get with a full gear range.

At EVELO, we give a patented mid-drive electric motor, which is included with the crank and the gears. This provides several advantages:
**1. Increased performance whilst spending less battery energy, because the mid-travel motor uses the bike’s existing gears;**
**2. Much better hill climbing power, because you can switch gears based on the incline; and**
**3. Handling is improved, because the motor is positioned nearer to the bottom, keeping the pounds centered and low.**

# The Battery

Since the battery impacts the weight, design, and selection of the bike, its choice is essential. Batteries play a huge part in how electrical bikes work. A lot of the batteries you’ll get offered out there fall into one of the following two categories:

## Sealed Lead Acid (SLA)

These batteries were after the standard electric battery type for most electric scooters and electric bicycles. These days, most electric scooters still employ SLA batteries, while electrical bikes (which frequently require human input) have chosen newer battery technologies to keep carefully the bike as lightweight as possible.

### Advantages

- Inexpensive

### Disadvantages

- Heavy and bulky
- Provide a shorter riding range
- Shorter life span around 100-300 total cycle charges
- Require extra maintenance, and ought to be charged soon after use

## Lithium (Ion/Polymer/Manganese/etc.)

These are the latest technology in batteries. A lithium electric battery has a lifetime roughly 2-3 moments that of an SLA battery pack. Lithium batteries happen to be much lighter and in addition are largely maintenance-free.

### Advantages

- Lightweight: high-capacity, 36V10Ah Lithium-Polymer batteries can weigh less than 6 pounds!
- Provide a longer riding range: electric battery can travel up to 40 miles in pedal-assist mode (or perhaps 20 miles on throttle-only).
- Longer life span of about 800 charges or 3 years of practically daily use

### Disadvantages

- More expensive: starting at about $1,500 to $3,000 and above

# The Controller

Available in a number of types, the controller enables you to operate the electric assistance on your own electric bike and is a crucial part in how electrical bikes work. The controller is situated on the handlebar for simplicity. There are two main styles of controllers - pedal-activated and throttle-based controllers.

Pedal-activated systems offer electrical assistance as you press downwards on the pedals. You don't have to engage a throttle - straightforward pedalling will do the trick. Electric powered bikes with pedal-activated devices have a controller mounted on the handlebar that enables you to adjust the amount of assistance you get as you pedal. You can dial in the amount of assistance you need, ranging from no assistance to a great deal of assistance.

Throttle-based controllers work with a simple throttle mechanism. The throttle will either be considered a twist-grasp type or a thumb-press type. With a throttle, you just pull back again or press the throttle to get the electrical assistance. Some electrical bikes require only activating the throttle, enabling you to ride without pedalling.

More often than not, electric bikes are easy to use, ride, and maintain. Overall, they might need little maintenance beyond whatever a standard bike requires.
